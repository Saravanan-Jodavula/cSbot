# cSbot
Whenever an update is made to bot.js file, contact Executive so that he can push the file to heroku.

And also, keep the version up to date.

The custom convention we follow: x.x.y

y   --> increment whenever a feature is edited.

x.x --> represents the number of features existing till now from 1.0    
        i.e, 2.2.y indicates we have 12 features, incremented from 1.0.y to 2.2.y
